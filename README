Runner Template
----------------------

-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/runner/is/installed
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX .. 
make 
make install

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Plasma setup, replace it accordingly)

Restart krunner to load the runner
(in a terminal type: 
kquitapp krunner 
and then
krunner)

After this you should see your runner in the system settings:

systemsettings5 (Head to "Search")

You can also launch KRunner via Alt-F2 and you will find your runner.
